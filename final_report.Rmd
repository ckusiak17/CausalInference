#Step 0: Specify the Scientific Question  

##Background  

50-70 million Americans have chronic sleep problems and 35.5% of adults report getting less than 7 hours of sleep a day [@cdc].  Everyone knows the implications of not getting enough sleep. It has been linked to many health problems such as obesity, mood disorders, and heart disease [@wgbh]. Getting a good night’s sleep gives the body the necessary time to recover and is shown to improve memory [@wgbh2]. People across the country test herbal supplements, meditation and prescription drugs to fight insomnia. However, some studies have shown that exercise alone can help improve the quality of sleep [@sleepfoundation]. We set out to examine this relationship and see if exercise does indeed cause better sleep quality.  


##The Data

Our data come from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted by the US National Center for Health Statistics and can found in the `NHANES` package in R. These data were collected between the years of 2009 and 2012 across the United States. It includes information on a variety of diseases, medical conditions, and health indicators. The original set has 76 variables and 10,000 observations [@nhanes].  

The `NHANES` includes duplicate rows in order to fix problems associated with oversampling. We decided to remove these duplicates. We also ran a series of stepwise regressions to identify key covariates. After these reductions, we have a final dataset with 10 variables and 4,654 observations. Unfortunately, although this dataset has information on multiple years, the participants all have unique identifiers and thus can not be analyzed in a longitudinal setting. `NA`s were transformed as factor levels labeled as "Undisclosed."  

##The Variables  

### Exposure

- `PhysActive`: is a binary variable ($Yes=1$, $No=0$) representing whether the participant does moderate or vigorous-intensity sports, fitness or recreational activities.

### Outcome

- `SleepTrouble`: is a binary variable ($Yes=1$, $No=0$) representing whether the participant has reported having trouble sleeping to a healthcare professional.

### Covariates

#### Demographic Covariates

1. `Gender`: is a binary variable ($Female=0$, $Male=1$) representing the gender of the participant.
2. `Age`: is a numeric variable representing the age in years at screening of study participant. Note that we do not consider participants younger than $20$, and participants older than $80$ were recorded as $80$.
3. `Race1`: categorical variable representing the reported race of participant: `Mexican`, `Hispanic`, `White`, `Black`,`Other`.
4. `Education`: categorical variable representing the reported educational level of study participant: `8thGrade`, `9-11Grade`, `HighSchool`, `SomeCollege`, `CollegeGrad`.
5. `MaritalStatus`: categorical variable representing the reported marital status of study participant: `Married`, `Widowed`, `Divorced`, `Separated`, `NeverMarried`, `LivePartner`.
6. `HHIncomeMid`: numeric variable representing the median of reported income category of study participant.
7. `HomeOwn`: categorical variable representing whether the home of study participant is owned, rented or occupied by some other arrangement: `Home`, `Rent`, `Other`.

#### Health Covariates

8. `HealthGen`: categorical variable representing self-reported rating of participant's health in general: `Excellent`, `Vgood`, `Good`, `Fair`, `Poor`.
9. `DaysPhysHlthBad`: numeric variable representing the self-reported number of days participant's physical health was not good out of the past 30 days.
10. `DaysMentHlthBad`: numeric variable representing the self-reported number of days participant's mental health was not good out of the past 30 days.
11. `LittleInterest`: categorical variable representing the self-reported number of days participant had little interest in doing things: `None`, `Several`, `Majority`,`AlmostAll`.
12. `Depressed`: categorical variable representing the self-reported number of days participant felt down, depressed or hopeless: `None`, `Several`, `Majority`,`AlmostAll`.

#### Lifestyle Covariates

13. `TVHrsDay`: categorical variable representing the self-reported average number of hours per day participant watched TV over the past 30 days: `0_to_1hr`, `1_hr`, `2_hr`, `3_hr`, `4_hr`, `More_4_hr`. 
14. `CompHrsDay`: categorical variable representing the self-reported average number of hours per day participant used a computer or gamind device over the past 30 days: `0_to_1hr`, `1_hr`, `2_hr`, `3_hr`, `4_hr`, `More_4_hr`. 
15. `AlcoholDay`: numeric variable representing the reported average number of drinks consumed on days that participant drank alcohol beverages.
16. `SmokeNow`: binary variable ($Yes=1$, $No=0$) representing whether the participant currently smokes cigarettes regularly.
17. `RegularMarij`: binary variable ($Yes=1$, $No=0$) representing whether the participant has been or is a regular marijuana user (used at least once a month for a year).
18. `HardDrugs`: binary variable ($Yes=1$, $No=0$) representing whether the participant hs tried cocaine, crack cocaine, heroin or metamphetamine.


##Scientific Question and Target Population  

Among American adults aged 20 years or older, how does participating in moderate or vigorous-intensity sports, fitness or recreational activities affect sleep quality?




#Step 1: Specify the Causal Model    

##Option 1  

Our endogenous variables are X = {W, A, Y} which are defined as:  

W= {$W_d, W_h, W_l$}  
$W_d$ = {Gender, Age, Race1, Education, MaritalStatus, HHIncomeMid, HomeOwn}  
$W_h$ = {HealthGen, DaysPhysHlthBad, DaysMentHlthBad, LittleInterest, Depressed}  
$W_l$ = {TVHrsDay, CompHrsDay, AlcoholDay, SmokeNow, RegularMarij, HardDrugs}  
A = {PhysActive}  
Y = {SleepTrouble}    

Our exogenous variables are U = ${U_{W_d}, U_{W_h}, U_{W_l}, U_A, U_Y} ~ P_U$. These are the unmeasured factors which influence what values our endogenous variables, X can take. 

Our structural causal model is defined as:

$W_d = f_{W_d}(U_{W_d})$  
$W_h = f_{W_h}(W_d, U_{W_h})$  
$W_l = f_{W_l}(W_d, W_h, U_{W_l})$  
$A = f_A(W_d, W_h, W_l, U_A)$  
$Y = f_Y(W_d, W_h, W_l, A, U_Y)$    

A directed acyclic graph displays this SCM below.

##Option 2  

Our endogenous variables X = {W, A, Z, Y} which are defined as:

W = {$W_d, W_h, W_l$}  
$W_d$ = {Gender, Age, Race1, Education, MaritalStatus, HHIncomeMid, HomeOwn}  
$W_h$ = {HealthGen, DaysPhysHlthBad, DaysMentHlthBad, LittleInterest}  
$W_l$ = {TVHrsDay, CompHrsDay, AlcoholDay, SmokeNow, RegularMarij, HardDrugs}  
A = {PhysActive}  
Z = {Depressed}  
Y = {SleepTrouble}  

Our exogenous variables are U = {$U_{W_d}, U_{W_h}, U_{W_l}, U_A, U_Z U_Y$} $\sim P_U$. These are the unmeasured factors which influence what values our endogenous variables, X can take. 

Our structural causal model is defined as:

$W_d = f_{W_d}(U_{W_d})$  
$W_h = f_{W_h}(W_d, U_{W_h})$  
$W_l = f_{W_l}(W_d, W_h, U_{W_l})$  
$A = f_A(W_d, W_h, W_l, U_A)$  
$Z = f_Z(W_d, W_h, W_l, A, U_Z)$  
$Y = f_Y(W_d, W_h, W_l, A, Z, U_Y)$  

A directed acyclic graph displays this SCM below.   

![Structural Causal Model Option 2.](step1_option2.png)  

This alternative model defines Depressed as an intermediary between the exposure and outcome. Both models are valid, however we will proceed with the first model in the following analyses.  


#Step 2: Translation in the Target Causal Parameter Using Counterfactuals    

Here, our intervention node A is physical activity. This is forcing each participant to either do moderate to vigorous physical activity or do no physical activity. 



Our post-intervention SCM is then:

$W_d = f_{W_d}(U_{W_d})$  
$W_h = f_{W_h}(W_d, U_{W_h})$  
$W_l = f_{W_l}(W_d, W_h, U_{W_l})$  
A = a  
$Y_a = f_{W_l}(W_d, W_h, W_l, a, U_Y)$    


![Post-Intervention Structural Causal Model.](step2.png)  

The counterfactuals we are interested in are $Y_A: a \ \in A$ where A = {0,1}. Ya represents the individual’s SleepTrouble if possibly contrary to fact, they received the intervention A = a. 

Our causal parameter is the causal risk difference in SleepTrouble if every participant did moderate-vigorous physical activity vs. if no participant did physical activity. This can be written as:   

$$\Psi^F(P_{U,X}) = P_{U,X}(Y_1=1) - P_{U,X}(Y_0=1) = E_{U,X}(Y_1) - E_{U,X}(Y_0)$$  




#Step 3: Specify the Observed Data and its Link 

Our observed data consists of 4,654 independent and identically distributed copies of the random variable O which follows the distribution $P_O$. O = {$W_l, W_d, W_h, A, Y$} $\sim P_O$ where $W_l$ consists of the lifestyle covariates, $W_h$ consists of the health covariates, $W_d$ consists of the demographic covariates, A is the intervention node of physical activity, and Y is the outcome variable representing sleep trouble. We can assume that our observed data comes from 4,654 i.i.d. samples from the data generating process described by $M^F$. This links our causal $M^F$ with the statistical model $M$. This model $M$ does not have any restrictions and is therefore non-parametric.
