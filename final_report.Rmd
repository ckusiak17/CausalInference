#Step 0: Specify the Scientific Question  

##Background  

50-70 million Americans have chronic sleep problems and 35.5% of adults report getting less than 7 hours of sleep a day [@cdc].  Everyone knows the implications of not getting enough sleep. It has been linked to many health problems such as obesity, mood disorders, and heart disease [@wgbh]. Getting a good nightâ€™s sleep gives the body the necessary time to recover and is shown to improve memory [@wgbh2]. People across the country test herbal supplements, meditation and prescription drugs to fight insomnia. However, some studies have shown that exercise alone can help improve the quality of sleep [@sleepfoundation]. We set out to examine this relationship and see if exercise does indeed cause better sleep quality.  


##The Data

Our data come from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted by the US National Center for Health Statistics and can found in the `NHANES` package in R. These data were collected between the years of 2009 and 2012 across the United States. It includes information on a variety of diseases, medical conditions, and health indicators. The original set has 76 variables and 10,000 observations [@nhanes].  

The `NHANES` includes duplicate rows in order to fix problems associated with oversampling. We decided to remove these duplicates. We also ran a series of stepwise regressions to identify key covariates. After these reductions, we have a final dataset with 10 variables and 4,654 observations. Unfortunately, although this dataset has information on multiple years, the participants all have unique identifiers and thus can not be analyzed in a longitudinal setting. `NA`s were transformed as factor levels labeled as "Undisclosed."  

##Scientific Question and Target Population  

Among American adults aged 20 years or older, how does participating in moderate or vigorous-intensity sports, fitness or recreational activities affect sleep quality?




#Step 1: Specify the Causal Model    

##Option 1  

Our endogenous variables are X = {W, A, Y} which are defined as:  

W= {$W_d, W_h, W_l$}  
$W_d$ = {Gender, Age, Race1, Education, MaritalStatus, HHIncomeMid, HomeOwn}  
$W_h$ = {HealthGen, DaysPhysHlthBad, DaysMentHlthBad, LittleInterest, Depressed}  
$W_l$ = {TVHrsDay, CompHrsDay, AlcoholDay, SmokeNow, RegularMarij, HardDrugs}  
A = {PhysActive}  
Y = {SleepTrouble}    

Our exogenous variables are U = ${U_{W_d}, U_{W_h}, U_{W_l}, U_A, U_Y} ~ P_U$. These are the unmeasured factors which influence what values our endogenous variables, X can take. 

Our structural causal model is defined as:

$W_d = f_{W_d}(U_{W_d})$  
$W_h = f_{W_h}(W_d, U_{W_h})$  
$W_l = f_{W_l}(W_d, W_h, U_{W_l})$  
$A = f_A(W_d, W_h, W_l, U_A)$  
$Y = f_Y(W_d, W_h, W_l, A, U_Y)$

##Option 2  

Our endogenous variables X = {W, A, Z, Y} which are defined as:

W = {$W_d, W_h, W_l$}  
$W_d$ = {Gender, Age, Race1, Education, MaritalStatus, HHIncomeMid, HomeOwn}  
$W_h$ = {HealthGen, DaysPhysHlthBad, DaysMentHlthBad, LittleInterest}  
$W_l$ = {TVHrsDay, CompHrsDay, AlcoholDay, SmokeNow, RegularMarij, HardDrugs}  
A = {PhysActive}  
Z = {Depressed}  
Y = {SleepTrouble}  

Our exogenous variables are U = {$U_{W_d}, U_{W_h}, U_{W_l}, U_A, U_Z U_Y$} $\sim P_U$. These are the unmeasured factors which influence what values our endogenous variables, X can take. 

Our structural causal model is defined as:

$W_d = f_{W_d}(U_{W_d})$  
$W_h = f_{W_h}(W_d, U_{W_h})$  
$W_l = f_{W_l}(W_d, W_h, U_{W_l})$  
$A = f_A(W_d, W_h, W_l, U_A)$  
$Z = f_Z(W_d, W_h, W_l, A, U_Z)$  
$Y = f_Y(W_d, W_h, W_l, A, Z, U_Y)$

This alternative model defines Depressed as an intermediary between the exposure and outcome. Both models are valid, however we will proceed with the first model in the following analyses.
